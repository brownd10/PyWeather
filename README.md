Three observations from the datasets:

1) I ran the sample over a dozen times and overwhelming the sample was concentrated in the northern hemisphere above the equator, which shows that the closer one gets to equater - the hotter the temps are (as expected) with only a few outliers!

2) My sampe seems to hint at the fact that Humidity (%) and Cloudiness (%) are closely aligned as the scatterplot appears to mirror close to one another

3) Wind Speed (mph) shows the greatest dispersion of data among the samples selected.
